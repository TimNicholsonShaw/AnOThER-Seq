AnoThER-Seq 1.0

A pipeline developed by the Lykke-Andersen Lab for the analysis of changes in the 3' end of small RNAs.

Library preparation used with this pipeline:
- 3' linker ligation (with random 3' sequence to remove duplicates)
- Reverse Transcription
- 5' Linker ligation
- PCR to add illumina indexes
- Size selection for 50-500nt

No fragmentation is done in order to preserve the 3' ends of each read.

This pipeline uses read1 to find random the random nucleotide sequence appended to the 3' end of the RNA during library
preparation and removes duplicate reads. A .count file is created (CSV type) of unique sequences in the form
[Sequence, Total Reads, Unique Reads]. The counts are aligned using the BLAST algorithm to a database in the databases
folder that can be specified. Using the alignments, the 3' composition of each read is judged and a .tail file is created
with that information. The .tail file is CSV formatted with headers [sequence, unique reads, gene name, 3' end location,
tail length, tail sequence]. The tail file can be used for downstream analysis. Examples of how analysis functions can
be used can be found in the notebook folder.

Mandatory arguments:
    -i: fastq file location. Use read 1.
    -o: Folder to put counts file and tail file into. Make sure it ends with the file delimiter
    -b: Length of random mer. Total length of added nucleotides. AG10 = 10, AG11 = 11, can be 0 if nothing is added

Optional arguments
    -db: Name of database to use. Must be in databases folder. superset_withtRNA.fa is the default
    -n: Name to give files. Default is "output"
    -m: Allowed mismatch in the random barcode. Default is 1. If random barcode has 1 difference between eachother,
        they'll be called duplicates
